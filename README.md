## MOTIVATION

>> why created this as an application?
>> well didn't really have enough god skill to master and play around with the sdk for sure,
>> came up with this idea if i could implement a simple way that user can interact the namada ecosystem in much easy wasy :)) not saying mine is perfect ofcourse having this on namada.me would be game changer

>> for sure it's a lame way of impl. but it solve something(better than nothing at all)

>> did a crazy research on how to implement and here it is!

>> what drives me to build this


>> had a hard time familarzing what is shielded swap, and what are ibc shielded swap, and usually takes time and to be on goods hand, so a shell application where it does everything for you instead of getting into commands and moving arounds docs and later screwing all of em just because i dont know what is spending key, shielded key and transparent.

>> to be fair, it takes a quite effort and time to perform txn such ibc-gen-shield and transfer and a proper understanding on the addresses required

>> on the security basis it's trust and all faith
>> we have not installed any malacious code and backdoor to harvest or extract information, the github link to it >>



>> if you have read this far thank you :) appreciate your time 
>> ahh okay let me continue here with the swap mech
>> 
>> for the swap mech implement a middleware that listen to upcoming request through our endpoint

>> implemented an NAAN <> IBC/ATOM On osmosis pool(314)

>> swap for it real time, based of the pool weight


>> then it sends back the swap tokens back to the receiving addresss

-----that's it
